# Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce and logistics, small to medium-sized businesses often struggle with the manual processing of high-volume orders received through unstructured channels like WhatsApp voice notes and phone calls. This manual entry is time-consuming, prone to human error, and creates a bottleneck in the delivery pipeline.

The **Order Automation System** proposed in this project aims to revolutionize this workflow by leveraging advanced Generative AI and modern web technologies. The core solution involves an intelligent ingestion engine capable of transcribing voice notes and parsing unstructured text messages to automatically extract structured order data (customer details, delivery location, and items) with high accuracy.

The system is built using a robust Microservices-inspired Monorepo architecture, utilizing **Next.js** for a responsive management dashboard, **Supabase** for scalable real-time database and authentication, and **Google Gemini** for the AI processing layer. Key features include an automated dispatching algorithm that assigns orders to drivers based on proximity and availability, a driver mobile application for real-time tracking, and a comprehensive admin panel for analytics and oversight.

Initial testing demonstrates that the system significantly reduces order processing time and minimizes strict manual data entry errors. This project not only streamlines operational efficiency for businesses but also provides a scalable foundation for future integration with third-party logistics providers.
