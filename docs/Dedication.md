# Dedication

We dedicate this project to our loving parents, whose endless support, prayers, and sacrifices have been the driving force behind our success. Their belief in us has given us the strength to overcome every challenge.

To our honorable teachers and supervisor, for their guidance, wisdom, and patience throughout this journey. You have not only taught us technical skills but also life lessons that we will carry forever.

And finally, to our friends and team members, whose collaboration, hard work, and shared vision made this project a reality.
